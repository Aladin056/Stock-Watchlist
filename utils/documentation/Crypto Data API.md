- Nomics is a cryptocurrency data API focused on Price, crypto market cap, supply, and all-time high data. They offer Candle/OHLC data for currencies & exchanges. Additionally, they supply historical aggregate cryptocurrency market cap since January of 2013.
Nomics API is a resource for all developers. Their prices can seem expensive to the typical developer who is searching for a cheap or free crypto API. Nonetheless, they are a well respected API within the crypto industry.

I propose creating an aggregated model which gets data from multiple APIs.
